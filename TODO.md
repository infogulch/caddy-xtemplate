# TODO

- [ ] Update `xtemplate-caddy`. Note only caddy 2.8.0 uses Go 1.22
  - [ ] Figure out how to run caddy with xtemplate
  - [ ] Must test on caddy head?
  - [ ] Accept dot provider configuration from Caddyfile
- [ ] Add .TemplateLazy that renders a template to a io.ReadSeeker after the
  first call to a method. Can be used for mail, servecontent, etc
  - https://github.com/spatialcurrent/go-lazy ?
- [ ] Add NATS module:
  - [ ] Subscribe to subject, loop on receive to send via open SSE connection
  - [ ] Publish message to subject
  - [ ] Request-Reply
- [ ] Add mail module:
  - [ ] Send mail, send mail by rendering template
  - https://github.com/Shopify/gomail
- [ ] Use https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-frontmatter
- [ ] Publish docker image, document docker usage
- [ ] Pass Config.Ctx down to http.Server/net.Listener to allow caller to cancel
  .Serve() and associated instances.

### Testing

- [ ] Test configuration methods
  - [ ] CLI
  - [ ] Go API
- [ ] Test dot providers
  - [ ] FS
  - [ ] DB

### Documentation

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Using different databases
    - Should be documented with DotDBProvider go docs (?)
  - [ ] Using the new go-arg cli flags
  - [ ] Using json config
  - [ ] Creating a provider

### Application

- [ ] Measure performance
- [ ] Make and link to more example applications
  - [ ] Demo/test how to use sql
  - [ ] Demo/test reading and writing to the context fs
- [ ] Demonstrate how to do auth with xtemplate
  - [ ] [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth#forward-auth) / [Trusted Header SSO](https://www.authelia.com/integration/trusted-header-sso/introduction/)
- [ ] Demo integration with [caddy-git](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-git) for zero-CI app deployments

# BACKLOG

- [ ] Review https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate for data source ideas
- [ ] Fix `superfluous response.WriteHeader call from github.com/felixge/httpsnoop.(*Metrics).CaptureMetrics` https://go.dev/play/p/spBB4w7nBCZ
- [ ] Accept Env configuration
- [ ] Built-in CSRF token handling
  * https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery
- [ ] Fine tune timeouts? https://ieftimov.com/posts/make-resilient-golang-net-http-servers-using-timeouts-deadlines-context-cancellation/
- [ ] Idea: Add special FILE pseudo-func that is replaced with a string constant of the current filename.
  - Potentially useful for invoking a template file with a relative path. (Add
    DIR constant too?)
  - Parse().Tree.Root.(*ListNode).[].(recurse) where NodeType()==NodeIdentifier replace with StringNode
- [ ] Modify relative path invocations to point to the local path. https://pkg.go.dev/text/template/parse@go1.22.1#TemplateNode
  - Should be fine?
- [ ] See if its possible to implement sql queryrows with https://go.dev/wiki/RangefuncExperiment
  - Not until caddy releases 2.8.0 and upgrades to 1.22.
- [ ] Add command that pre-compresses static files?
- [ ] Schema migration? https://david.rothlis.net/declarative-schema-migration-for-sqlite/
- [ ] Schema generator: https://gitlab.com/Screwtapello/sqlite-schema-diagram/-/blob/main/sqlite-schema-diagram.sql?ref_type=heads
- [ ] Add a way to register additional routes dynamically during init
- [ ] Organize docs according to https://diataxis.fr/
