# TODO

- [ ] Fix dockerfile
- [ ] Create system for optional modules. Config/DB/FS/NATS. Inject?
- [ ] Integrate nats:
    - [ ] Subscribe to subject, loop on receive to send via open SSE connection
    - [ ] Publish message to subject
    - [ ] Request-Reply

### Automation

- [ ] Write Go api tests
- [ ] Write CLI tests

### Application

- [ ] Make and link to more example applications
    - [ ] Demo/test how to use sql
    - [ ] Demo/test reading and writing to the context fs
- [ ] Demonstrate how to do auth with xtemplate
    - [ ] [forward_auth](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/forward_auth#forward-auth) / [Trusted Header SSO](https://www.authelia.com/integration/trusted-header-sso/introduction/)
- [ ] Demo integration with [caddy-git](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-git) for zero-CI app deployments

# BACKLOG

- [ ] Add a way to register additional routes dynamically during init
- [ ] Organize docs according to https://diataxis.fr/
- [ ] Fine tune timeouts? https://ieftimov.com/posts/make-resilient-golang-net-http-servers-using-timeouts-deadlines-context-cancellation/
- [ ] Idea: Add special FILE pseudo-func that is replaced with a string constant of the current filename.
    - Potentially useful for invoking a template file with a relative path. (Add
      DIR constant too?)
    - Parse().Tree.Root.(*ListNode).[].(recurse) where NodeType()==NodeIdentifier replace with StringNode
- [ ] Modify relative path invocations to point to the local path. https://pkg.go.dev/text/template/parse@go1.22.1#TemplateNode
    - Should be fine?
- [ ] Add command that pre-compresses static files
- [ ] Pass Config.Ctx down to http.Server/net.Listener to allow caller to cancel
  .Serve() and associated instances.
